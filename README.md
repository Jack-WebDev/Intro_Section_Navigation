Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

An extra S/O to Brad Traversy and Kevin Powell for availing free resources to help me improve my coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview

My challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

My users should be able to: 

- View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
